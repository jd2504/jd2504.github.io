<p>The parallels between these two are stretched and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be more of a relationship between them than other pairs (Jefferson and Madison come to mind, or even Jefferson and Adams&#x27; relationship as frenemies). While reading this account, I couldn&#x27;t help but to draw parallels between the offenses to Americans that were the Stamp Act, Townsend Acts, and other levies to the atrocious and terribly executed Liberation Day tariffs. We&#x27;ll have to wait and see what the Boston Tea Party responses of our time might be.</p>
