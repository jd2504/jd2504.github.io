<p>Travels with George, Philbrick</p>
<br>
<p>Why I finished this book is a mystery to me. It is neither a good piece of history, nor self-reflection. These are diary pages better left hidden as scrawls in a lined notebook under a pillow, illegible as they are unreadable. Philbrick recounts a conversation with a Washington interpreter-slash-impressionist at Monticello who attributes the difficulty in relating to current audiences to screentime. Other examples throughout the book are either equally unenlightening and shallow or meaningless.</p>
