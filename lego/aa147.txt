Journey to the Edge of Reason: The Life of Kurt Gödel, Budiansky, 2021

I learned about as much about turn of the century Vienna, the Vienna Circle, and Nazi-occupied Austria as I did about Gödel's ideas. This was very much a 'life of'. But otherwise, well written enough. Came across another book about Moritz Schlick's murder that I may check out.
