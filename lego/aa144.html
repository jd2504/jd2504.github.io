    <h1> Orbital, Harvey S., 2024</h1>
<p>&quot;Rotating about the earth in their spacecraft they are so together, and so alone, that even their thoughts, their internal mythologies, at times convene.&quot; [p.1]</p>
<p>The thread of common humanity runs deep through this book but start far from the surface for six astronauts on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>&quot;And so it is, but in this new day they&#x27;ll circle the earth sixteen times. They&#x27;ll see sixteen sunrises and sixteen sunsets, sixteen days and sixteen nights. Roman clasps the handrail by the window to steady himself; the southern hemisphere stars are fleeting away. You&#x27;re bound to Coordinated Universal Time, ground crews tell them. Be clear with yourself on this matter, always clear. Look often at your watch to anchor your mind, tell yourself when you wake up: this is the morning of a new day.&quot; [6]</p>
<p>I found that on orbit seven, page one hundred, for a moment I confused sun-up with whatever the morning means in this context, just like during many other ascending orbits in this book. Only one of the many ways that we&#x27;re coaxed into viewing humanity and ourselves from a wildly different lens. We are the biological product of our environment, both in terms of our own lifetime and in evolutionary time.</p>
<p>&quot;The mice seem to take this news with a degree of stoicism. That&#x27;s what you must be, she says. Always stoic. She strokes her thumb along a sharp spine. She will miss her mother&#x27;s bone-picking ceremony, when they comb the ashes for fragments of bone that survived cremation. Missing that will be the hardest thing.&quot; [75]</p>
<p>In the Space Station or on Earth, we can&#x27;t help but experience now through our past and our memories. This is one of the many intimately human moments in this book, more of which belong to the Japanese astronaut, Chie as she thinks about her mother.</p>
<p>&quot;He should have said, I don&#x27;t know my love. That would have been true. Because who can look at man&#x27;s neurotic assault on the planet and find it beatiful? Man&#x27;s hubris. A hubris so almighty it&#x27;s matched only by his stupidity. And these phallic ships thrust into space are surely the most hubristic of them all, the totems of a species gone mad with self-love.&quot; [79]</p>
<p>While this book isn&#x27;t a lover&#x27;s glance at Earth, neither is it a particularly loving glance at humanity.</p>
<p>&quot;We have all been travelling, the crew thinks, travelling for years with barely a moment of settling; all of us living out of bags and borrowed places, hotels, space centres and training facilities, sleeping on friends&#x27; sofas in midway cities between one training course and another. Living in caves and submarines and deserts to test our mettle. If we have any single thing in common it&#x27;s our acceptance of belonging nowhere and everywhere in order to reach this, this near-mythical craft. This last nationless, borderless outpost that strains against the tethers of biological life.&quot; [94]</p>
<p>Rather than looking at Earth with a lover&#x27;s eye, as the quote from The Guardian says, it&#x27;s looking at this small sample of humanity from the same up-close perspective, under strains and conditions unimaginable to all but a few. The subject is not the stars or Earth or space in its vastness but humanity. Only under very different pressures.</p>
<p>&quot;...it&#x27;s then that you look down with a fuller view, as if to check that the earth and its seas are not just dreams or mirages, and there it is again, earth, turning blue and cloud-scudded and improbably soft against the truss of the craft you are navigating around. No longer frightening at all, instead a sight of such magnificence it shoots your senses apart.&quot; [102]</p>
<p>That&#x27;s not to say that the views of Earth don&#x27;t invoke our senses of awe and wonder. But it&#x27;s somewhat meaningless to separate ourselves from Earth in this way, and maybe it&#x27;s pointless to argue that the book&#x27;s concern is &#x27;us&#x27; rather than Earth. We are the Earth&#x27;s product, but not bounded by its constraints. We can escape Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and gaze back down at it, our source and place of inception, individually, as a species, as a terrestrial lifeform.</p>
<p>&quot;...wherever mankind goes it leaves some kind of destruction behind it, perhaps the nature of all life, to do this.&quot; [102]</p>
<p>Still not a lover&#x27;s glance.</p>
<p>&quot;Dusk steals upon you and the earth is a brusing of azure and purple and green, and you remove your sun visor and turn on your light and darkness brings out the stars and Asia passes by bejewelled and you work in your light-pool until the sun comes up once more behind you and burnishes an ocean you can&#x27;t identify. Daylight spills blue on a snowy landmass moving into view and, against the black, the rim of the earth is a light bright mauve that brings a pain of elation to the gut. What might be the Gobi Desert rolls out beneath you while ground crews give soothing instructions and your partner leafs through the manual attached to the arm of his spacesuit and you can just about see his face through the sun visor, a tranquil oval of a human face in the enormous anonymity of your landscape, and meanwhile the solar arrays drink the sun until dusk comes back and your partner is blackened by the sunset behind him and night creeps from the underside of the earth and engulfs it.&quot; [102]</p>
<p>Gasp...! From the vantage point of a cosmic stone&#x27;s-throw from Earth, her patterns of shape and color come into relief like a mosaic. Nell&#x27;s space-walk changes the way she &#x27;sees&#x27; space (from an inside window: &quot;It&#x27;s like looking through the bars at an animal you once ran with.&quot;), and while she&#x27;s out there, her breathless run-on stream-of-consciousness reads like the unbroken Penelope episode of Ulysses. I&#x27;m sure I in the same shoes would be even less articulate. And later, &quot;...the only word that seems to apply to it is unearthly. It can&#x27;t possibly be real. Forget all you know. You look back at the vast spread of the space station and in this moment it, not earth, feels like home.&quot; Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t make a difference. And that&#x27;s the point.</p>
<p>&quot;The night&#x27;s electric excess takes their breath. The spread of life. The way the planet proclaims to the abyss: there is something and someone here. And how, for all that, a sense of friendliness and peace prevails, since even at night there&#x27;s only one man-made border in the whole of the world; a long trail of lights between Pakistan and India. That&#x27;s all civilisation has to show for its divisions, and by day even that has gone.&quot; [106]</p>
<p>Out of sight, out of mind. Infantile country-first populist nationalism looks a lot different from space. A wonderful proclamation of life and common humanity dwarfs the terrible myopic divisions of our design. But even the astronauts seem to tire of it: &quot;...it&#x27;s the daytime earth they come to love. It&#x27;s the humanless simplicity of land and sea.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;They were warned in their training about the problem of dissonance. They were warned about what would happen with repeated exposure to this seamless earth. You will see, they were told, its fullness, its absence of borders except those between land and sea. You&#x27;ll see no countries, just a rolling indivisible globe which knows no possibility of separation, let alone war. And you&#x27;ll feel yourself pulled in two directions at once. Exhilaration, anxiety, rapture, depression, tenderness, anger, hope, despair. Because of course you know that war abounds and that borders are something that people will kill and die for... There&#x27;s no wall or barrier -- no tribes, no war or corruption or particular cause for fear.&quot;</p>
<p>The same could be said of transcendent experience on Earth. To gaze into the Grand Canyon, or look down from Mount Everest, or from an escarpment into an uninhabited valley. To view the rest of our miserable species as equally deserving of respect, happiness, a chance at The Good Life is not the same as absorbing the pain of all who are robbed of respect, happiness, life.</p>
