<p>Bowling Alone, Putnam R.</p>
<br>
<p>Data-rich, fastidiously researched, but stuffed of references to the church&#39;s role in community building. He spends about six-hundred pages showing how and why community, civic engagement, understanding of civil society, participation in community activities declined over the twentieth century and I doubt Putnam would be happy with the state of things, twenty years after he went to print (the 2020 rerelease has a new preface that I would be happy to find). Putnam frequently attributes our failing civic sensibilities to television to which Haidt&#39;s The Anxious Generation seems like a good, if not tangential, sequel to this thread. Putnam doesn&#39;t scuffle with or even make mention of social media, but he still manages to capture internet shallowness at least as well, if not better, than Carr&#39;s The Shallows.</p>
<br>
<p>On religion, Putnam seems to believe that decline in religious affiliation and participation is at least correlated, if not partly to blame for a faltering sense of community. Decline in religious participation isn&#39;t evenly distributed across Americans though. Those more actively involved are still involved, but those who are more conventionally or nominally religious have slumped, echoing broader sociopolitical trends like the shrinking populations of moderates, middle class, or other in-the-middles. Evangelicals are more likely to be involved in their own communities but less likely to participate in broader communities. I suppose this depends on your perspective, but this hardly seems like a positive thing to me. So social capital is invested &#39;within&#39; rather than toward a broader community. Mainline protestantism is also more involved in civic engagement than their evangelical sister congregations. The same contrast appears at congregational levels. Also, civil rights appears to be positively correlated with mainline religion (there is a high proportion of Christians among Black Americans, after all) but negatively correlated with fundamentalist churches. Putnam believes that religion and the church have been the strongest predictor of civic engagement. To which, the follow up question: &quot;of what type?&quot; Proselytizing isn&#39;t the same thing as financial education, sex ed, or other avenues for civic participation and social investment.</p>
