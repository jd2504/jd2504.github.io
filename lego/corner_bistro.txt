It has its fierce partisans. \ Iâ€™m not among them.
Mine was tender on the inside but had a dull flavor, and was flabby through and through, with no crispness whatsoever on the edges.


Growing up in Chicago in the mid-'80s, I remember going to a deep-dish pizza joint whose name I can't recall but whose tables I remember well. You walk through heavy doors into a dingy, wood-paneled dining room.

They proudly wear the butter-knife-penned scrawls of every other customer to enter the dingy establishment since a day after they opened, and long before you were born. It was the kind of place you'd trust the reviewers to get wrong as much as you know local's just get it. The same guy's been making pizzas for longer than you can remember


It's not just about the burger.
