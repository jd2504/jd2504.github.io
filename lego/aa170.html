    <h1>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, Manson M. 2016</h1>
<p>A deeply thoughtful work of questions into what life is about disguised as a bro Bible, I&#x27;m not the first to notice. Starting with the example of Bukowski&#x27;s does-not-give-a-fuck, he quickly slides into observations about how to discern what we should give a fuck about. He questions emotions, but observes that, while we might be taught to repress them (for those of us over, what? 40?), &quot;to deny one&#x27;s negative emotions is to deny many of the feedback mechanisms that help a person solve problems.&quot; We evolved feelings for a purpose. Or, in his words, pain serves a purpose. He&#x27;s quick to add that those that overidentify with their emotions come with their own issues, justifying every emotional outburst. Echoing many before him, he makes the point that problems are also recursive and unavoidable. The person you marry is the person you fight with. The dream job is the one you stress over. And whatever makes us feel good is exactly what makes us feel the worst. This book is a strong antidote to both exceptionalism and self deprication.</p>
