Illiberal America, Steven Hahn (2024)

Before opening the book, the title should already seem a surprising start.

Hahn argues that illiberalism is not a marginal undercurrent of American politics and society, but a prominent set of views located at the center. He walks through a series of historical episodes that show illiberal thought has always been beneath the surface, from racist politics of White nationalists and their predecessors, anti-Mormon and anti-Catholic fears, and other Thems.

He misses that the tides have consistently been moving in the direction of a broader and more concrete conception of liberty, a more inclusive view of rights, and increasing economic opportunity for all classes of American society.
