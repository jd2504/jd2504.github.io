    <h1>Original Sin, Tapper J., Thompson A.</h1>
<p>&quot;So what do we as a country do to ensure that this will never happen again?&quot; I wrote elsewhere about the salad of feelings of dismay, horror, and validation while watching &#x27;the&#x27; presidential debate between Trump and Biden. Original Sin collects in one place all of the reasons why that burlesque of June, 2024 should have never been allowed to happen, but did, to the credit of a parade of aids and staffers whose own self interest prevented them from sharing a procession of bad news, polls, insight, and widely held opinions that may have saved an election and a legacy.</p>
