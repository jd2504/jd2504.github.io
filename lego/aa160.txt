Franklin & Washington

The parallels between these two are stretched and there doesn't seem to be more of a relationship between them than other pairs (Jefferson and Madison come to mind, or even Jefferson and Adams' relationship as frenemies). While reading this account, I couldn't help but to draw parallels between the offenses to Americans that were the Stamp Act, Townsend Acts, and other levies to the atrocious and terribly executed Liberation Day tariffs. We'll have to wait and see what the Boston Tea Party responses of our time might be.
