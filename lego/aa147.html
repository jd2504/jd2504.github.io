<p>Journey to the Edge of Reason: The Life of Kurt Gödel, Budiansky, 2021</p>
<br>
<p>I learned about as much about turn of the century Vienna, the Vienna Circle, and Nazi-occupied Austria as I did about Gödel&#39;s ideas. This was very much a &#39;life of&#39;. But otherwise, well written enough. Came across another book about Moritz Schlick&#39;s murder that I may check out.</p>

<p>Further reading:</p>
<p>The Murder of Professor Schlick: The Rise and Fall of the Vienna Circle, Edmonds D., 2020</p>
<p>Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Gödel, Goldstein R., 2005</p>
<p>Logicomix, Christos Papadimitriou, 2008 (read a long time ago, remember enjoying, and worth finding again)</p>
