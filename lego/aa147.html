    <h1>Journey to the Edge of Reason: The Life of Kurt Gödel, Budiansky, 2021</h1>
<p>I learned about as much about turn of the century Vienna, the Vienna Circle, and Nazi-occupied Austria as I did about Gödel&#x27;s ideas. This was very much a &#x27;life of&#x27;. But otherwise, well written enough. Came across another book about Moritz Schlick&#x27;s murder that I may check out.</p>

<p>Logicomix, Christos Papadimitriou, 2008 (read a long time ago, remember enjoying, and worth finding again)</p>
